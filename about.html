I have educational experience working as a Teaching assistant for Texas A&M along with my previous position as a coding teacher at Codakid. I also worked as a short term mentor for the Spark engineering summer camp.

I’ve participated in several team design opportunities including L’space, NCAS, SEC directed internship, and two aggies invent competitions.

For personal achievements. I have several game projects I’ve worked on with one video-game placing top 10% in a 6,000 person game-jam competition. My most recent project involved creating a physics based plane controller using Godot. This can be seen in the link below.</p></div>
